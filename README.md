## Hello! My name's Christien ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer that loves creating complex applications with a simple UI. Some of my larger project include network routing with GTFS data and project OSRM. Currently working at SHARE Mobility.

I am also a swimmer training to at least get some new best times, fingers crossed for <em><strong>Paris 2024 :)</strong></em>, wish me luck!
