## Hello! My name's Christien ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer that loves creating complex applications with a simple UI. Some of my larger project include network routing with GTFS data and utilizing project OSRM. 

Outside of Programming I am a swimmer training to qualify for the Barbados Olympic team in 2024 (Paris). Wish me luck!
